      <h2>RECENT UPDATE:<br> ROGUE'S GALLERY</h2>
      <p>Hey everyone! So, update on the progress of the Rogue's Gallery world. Because of university projects, some
        characters may be getting reworks or redesigns soon! The first of those is Vulcan, who is being fused with the
        concept for Warlord. The two are very similar, and because of how non-fleshed out Warlord was, I felt that the
        best case of action was to fuse the two to create a stronger concept. <br><br>Secondly, design work for Azi
        Martin may
        finally begin soon! The concept for her is there, and there are several planned scenes with her and Fox, so I
        felt like she should finally get her own design. <br><br> Lastly, Since the ending of the Outcasts storyline,
        Eden needed
        a new home. So, I've placed her in this universe, with some more fleshed out details, like a full name (Eden
        Valdez), new hero name (LIGHTSTRIKE), and new position in The Guild!<br>

          <p>A deep sea Saphretean, thrust into a position of immense power because of a plan gone wrong and a relic of
            godlike power, Mitzi has a very chaotic life. Luckily, her and her new pirate crew seem to be able to handle
            it. Somewhat. <br>

          <p>Eden Valdez, aka Lighstrike, used to be a hero. That was before her home dimension was ripped to shreads.
            Having
            been saved by a Glitch and placed in another world, she has been working as an assassin ever since, while
            trying to find out if her old friends are still out there somewhere.<br>

          <p>Created by Nicebur. <br><br>
            V had a life before this. Before the darkness that clouds their vision, the memories barely clung to, and
            the
            hatred that burns slowly at their soul. The Glitch attempted to save them before, but are they even possible
            to save now? <br>

          <p>PROTOCOL: ELIMINATE.<br> Watcher Zero, like the other Watchers, used to be a force to
            keep the universe stable, but they now have a new prime directive: to hunt down Nyx,

          <p>Who would've thought, when you put 3 genius inventors, two aliens, and a cybernetically enhanced amputee
            soldier
            in a superhero team together, you get a suprisingly effective team. Fighting villains, family members,
